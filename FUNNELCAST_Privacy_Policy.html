Funnelcast Privacy Policy
<p>Last updated December 5, 2022</p>
<p>At Funnelcast, the privacy of our users and visitors are very
important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide you

Privacy Policy only applies to personal information collected about you
while you are accessing or using the Application. By registering to use
the Application or otherwise accessing the Application, you accept this
Privacy Policy and certify that you have reviewed it. IF YOU DO NOT
AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE

our applications, websites, content, and products and services.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION, WHAT DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO
WE USE IT?</strong></p>
<p>We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us
as well as data related to your use of the Application.  Below is a more
specific list of the personal information we collect and how we use it
with your consent. You may be asked additional questions regarding items
on this list to ensure we have your consent to collect and use your
personal information for specific purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support Requests: When you contact us for support, we may collect
personal information as part of the support process, including but not
limited to your name, username, address, telephone number, mobile
number, email address, and other information from which your identity is
or may be discernible.</p></li>
<li><p>Enterprise Access: If you are an enterprise customer (as opposed
to an individual user), we may require you provide us with contact
information for administrators or finance personnel as part of the setup
and provision of services to you and your users.</p></li>
<li><p>Surveys and User Research: We may send you surveys or contact you
with questions to provide us with feedback on our Application. We
collect any responses that you provide. Participation in surveys or
research tasks is elective and does not affect your access to the
Application.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may collect certain aggregate information and
analytical data related to your use of the Application (see “Use of
Cookies” below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or
anonymous information about you, and may include the date and time of
your visit, information about your usage of, and interaction with, our
software, the Application, the IP address of your computer or mobile
device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the internet
address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Application,
the name of the domain and host you used to access the internet, the
type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID,
the features of the Application which you accessed, and correspondences
between you and us. This data is not associated with your personally
identifiable information. We may also use cookies and web beacons to
track your interaction with the Application, and to customize our
Application for you.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide you the
Application.  We may use the information you provide to us for other
purposes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support the Application:  We may use the information you provide
us to provide any customer support you request, including
troubleshooting problems, and monitor such requests, and to inform you
about updates to the Application.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the Application:  We may use the information you provide
us to customize, measure, and improve the Application, including through
data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey
processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce Rights: We may use the information you provide us to
enforce your and our rights (including payment for the Application) and
to protect you against fraud. </p></li>
<li><p>Marketing Purposes: We occasionally may contact you about new
product and features. You may remove your name from our mailing lists to
stop receiving these emails.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the foregoing, or our privacy
practices, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@funnelcast.com">info@funnelcast.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CAN WE USE DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the uses of personal information above, we may remove
the identifiable parts of your information to create de-identified forms
(“De-identified Information”). De-identified Information may be compiled
with other data in aggregated forms. We use this aggregated or
non-aggregated data in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disclosure for Business Purposes: We may also license, sell or
otherwise share De-identified Information with clients, partners,
investors and contractors for any purposes related to our business
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Application Improvement: We may use De-identified Information for
product improvement including to the Application as well as share it
with third-parties to evaluate their products or services.</p></li>
<li><p>Research:  We may use De-identified Information for research
whether scientific, marketing, or business in nature. This research may
be made public through publication such as within a scientific
journal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer personally
identifiable information to third parties who are not our affiliates
without your consent to do so. We may, however, disclose personally
identifiable information: to our affiliated companies, carriers, third
party service providers and/or agents, as reasonably necessary to
provide you with the Application you have requested; as required by law
or legal process; in response to lawful requests for information by
governmental agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, authorized
to request such information; to enforce our contractual agreements,
including investigation of potential violations thereof; to help detect
and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies and
to otherwise protect our interests; to help detect and prevent harm to
persons or property or otherwise to protect public safety; to third
parties that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited
to, third parties that host or operate our Application, analyze data,
perform email list management services, provide customer service, or
provide public relations and marketing services; and to vendors of
products and services that are offered through the Application.</p>
<p>We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does
not permit direct association with any specific individual, or
non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the
number of users on the Application and the geographic distribution of
our users). As such, in no way to limit the foregoing, we may share
aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third
parties such as advertisers, industry organizations, and prospective
affiliates.</p>
<p>We do not enable third parties, except for certain of our
subcontractors, to collect information directly from users while they
interact with Application. Our subcontractors only collect and use
information at our direction and only to support the functioning of the
Application and to perform analytics. Our subcontractor may not share
this information with third parties.</p>
<p>As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we
could sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In any such
transaction, as well in the event all or substantially all of our assets
are acquired by a third party, personal information of our users will
generally be one of the transferred assets. We reserve the right to
include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such
transfer to a third party.</p>
<p>Information collected by or sent to us may be stored and processed in
any country in which we and our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service
providers maintain facilities. We reserve the right to transfer your
personal information outside of the country where you reside and/or from
which you use our Application. By using our Application you consent to
any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
<p><strong>HOW LONG IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION KEPT BY
US?</strong></p>
<p>We will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably
necessary to: provide the use of our Application; invoice charges and to
maintain records until invoices cannot be lawfully challenged and legal
proceedings may no longer be pursued; communicate with you regarding
other Applications that we offer; comply with applicable laws,
regulations, and court orders; enforce our contractual agreements; or
fulfill any of the purposes for which we collected the personal
information as listed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?</strong></p>
<p>A “Cookie” is a simple text file stored on your computer or device
for use by a browser. Certain Application features may only be available
through the placement of a cookie. We may use “cookies” to assist in
data collection and to track visitor Application usage and trends to
help us better serve you. The use of cookies is a standard practice
among internet web sites; most internet browsers permit a user to
accept, decline or delete cookies. We may use persistent cookies to make
it easier for you to navigate the Application. Specifically, we may use
persistent cookies to track whether you are logged into the Application,
have accepted the applicable terms of use and these privacy terms. A
persistent cookie may remain on your local device for an extended period
of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions
provided in your internet browser’s “help” function. We may set a
persistent cookie to store how you came to the Application and what
items you interact with during your visit. Persistent cookies also
enable tracking and targeting the interests of our users to enhance
their experience on the Application. If you reject cookies, you will
still be able to view contents through the Application, but your ability
to use some areas of the Application may be limited. Some of our
business partners may use cookies and tracking technologies on the
Application. We have no access to or control over these cookies or
tracking technologies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies on
our Application and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking
technologies by any such business partner.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>We follow commercially accepted industry standards to protect the
personal information submitted to or collected by us, both during
transmission and once we receive it. While we strive to use commercially
acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of
transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the event of an
inadvertent disclosure of your personal information, we will take all
commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure as
required by the applicable law. In light of the foregoing, your use and
access of the Application is at your own risk. If you have any questions
about security of our Application, please contact us in the manner set
forth under the heading “Contact Us” below.</p>

become aware that a person under the age of 18 has provided us with
personal information, we will take steps to remove such personal
information.</p>
<p><strong>HOW FAR DOES OUR RESPONSIBILITY EXTEND?</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Application that are owned and
operated by us. The Application and our communications to you may
contain links to other third party sites that may offer products or
services that our users might find useful. These third party sites may
request information from you. In such instances, the collection and use
of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy
applicable to that third party site. We do not and cannot control the
privacy policies, contents or links that appear on these third party
sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third
party sites or services before providing any of them with your personal
information. We accept no responsibility or liability for other third
party sites or services.</p>

OF OPT-OUT, ACCESS AND CORRECTION)?</strong></p>

information. Upon and subjection to verification of your identity, we
will respond to requests to view, correct, complete or remove your
personal information within a reasonable time. </p>
<p>We will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate requests to delete
personal information unless it is required by law or for any lawful
business purpose, and always will delete any personal information that
we are required by applicable law to delete at your request. </p>
<p>You can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by
notifying us of any changes to your personal information as soon as
possible. Your rights to access, change, or delete your personal
information are not absolute. We may deny you such rights when required
by law or if the request would likely reveal personal information about
a third party.</p>

identifiable information held by us, to allow you to verify that the

reflect changes in our Application and/or business practices. You are
encouraged to check regularly for any changes to this Privacy Policy.
Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all
information that we have about you. We will not materially change our
policies and practices to make them less protective of user information
collected in the past without the consent of affected users. You agree
that your continued use of the Application shall constitute your
acceptance of the Privacy Policy as revised. </p>
